# Bertelsmann Arvato PROJECT

### Summary
The objective of this project is to analyze the data collected by the company in order to optimize the mailing campaigns performed for their customers. This project consisted of 3 main steps:
- **Data exploration and cleaning**: This phase allowed an in-depth analysis of the data and the detection of anomalies in order to apply corrective actions.
- **Clustering**: the clustering phase first required the application of size reduction techniques, notably PCA, and then the use of a clustering algorithm.
- **Customer Acquisition using Supervised Learning**: This phase involved designing a model in order to better target the part of the population that corresponded to the company's customer profile. 


### Data description

- Customer Segmentation 
    -   General Population demographics
    -  Customer demographics
- Customer Acquisition 
    - Training data
    - Test data
- Description files
